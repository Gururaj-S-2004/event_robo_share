"""Local keyword search over data/rulebook.json - no network, no LLM.

Used to ground the LLM: we hand the top-matching rule(s) to llm.py as
context rather than trusting the model to know event-specific facts.

Callers deciding between the grounded path (llm.answer_question) and the
friendly ungrounded fallback (llm.answer_general) should use match(), not
search() directly - match() returns None as an explicit "nothing scored
above threshold" signal instead of silently handing back an empty list
that could be mistaken for "grounded, but with zero facts".
