"""Text-to-speech via Piper (offline, local .onnx voice model), played
immediately on the laptop's own speakers - the ESP32 never receives
synthesized audio (see ws_link.py / EventRobot.ino's WIRE PROTOCOL note).

Piper voices typically synthesize at 22050 Hz; we resample to
config.AUDIO_SAMPLE_RATE (16000) with simple linear interpolation - good
enough for spoken-word audio and avoids pulling in scipy/audioop just for
this.

Playback uses sounddevice (PortAudio) rather than simpleaudio: mic.py
already depends on it for recording, so reusing it here avoids a second
audio backend, and its prebuilt-wheel coverage across Windows/macOS/Linux
and Python versions is more reliable than simpleaudio's.
